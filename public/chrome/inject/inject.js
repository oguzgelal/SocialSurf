 * This script is injected into every single tab. It opens
 * a socket connection between the server and each tab. The purpose is
 * to monitor the online count to the url. A socket connection is
 * more reliable than listening to tab action because the online count
 * should also be decreased when a tab or chrome itself
 * terminates unexpectedly. When that happens, connection closes
 * and the server decreases the online count of the url which the
 * closed tab(s) was/were connected to.
